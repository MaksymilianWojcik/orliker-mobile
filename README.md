## About

This is a mobile REACT-NATIVE app for creating and managing amateur soccer games, mainly on artifical grass fields that belong to schools. In Poland we have a lot of fields like this (called 'orlik'). You can make reservations on these fields to play with your friends, generally people make reservations for specific day and hour for whole year (like every friday 8pm). People make those reservations to play with their friends, but sometimes it's not easy to find enough players, so special groups exist on facebook where you can add a post like 'need 1-2 players for today at 8pm'. There are also situations, where someone declared his presence, but in the last minute he resigned - in the meantime someone else wanted to join, but there was enough players already, and now he could join,but than you need to call him or write to him on facebook. In general managing you own reservation involes a lot of calls / messages etc. The purpose of this app is to significantly facilitate this progressr.
